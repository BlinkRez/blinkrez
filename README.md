Asynch DNS resolution and Happy Eyeballs library

This library aims to make async DNS (with DNSSEC validation) resolution possible in plain C, with minimal third-party dependencies other than libevent.  It will eventually also implement <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wing-v6ops-happy-eyeballs-ipv6> to make connecting via the correct version of IP easy.
